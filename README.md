  ## Description

  For challenge 11 `Note Taker` I added to the starter code to create an application that can be used to take notes. It was challenging to figure out how to write to the .json file but with the help of previous activites, specifically activity `22-Stu_Modular-Routing` in the `11-Express` folder I was able to get the notes to save to the .json file. The other challenging part was then getting the previous notes to display when clicked but with the help of `Stack Overflow` and this person's help [https://stackoverflow.com/a/42111989/19006972], I was able get everything to work. The previous Zoom recordings were very helpful aswell for deploying the application on Heroku. I did not get the delete buttons to work.

  When the user opens the application, they are presented with a note taker home page with a button to get started taking notes. When the button is pressed, the user is taken to the note's page where they can see a place to enter a note's title and the note's text. Once both feilds are entered a `save icon` appears in the top right and if pressed the note is saved to the preivous note list on the left side of the screen. If the user clicks one of the previous notes, then that note is displayed onto the page. If the user wants to create a new note, there is a `+` icon in the top right which clears the note's fields and allows the user to enter a new note.
